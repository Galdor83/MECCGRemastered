MECCGRemastered

Greetings! I started on this quest of preservation several years ago - using Magic Set Editor. I was manually retyping every card for the Middle Earth CCG (with updated errata) to capture the clearest images possible.  The existing card scans are great for on-screen display, but are much too low resolution for any other purpose.  After a lot of work, I decided to create brand new card frame artwork to allow for a high resolution image, with crisp text.  What you see here is the result of many months of work creating brand new, 300 dpi card frames for every type of card (including Dream Cards).  This project is not about creating perfect replicas of the original cards, but more of a homage to the originals.  It is a labor of love, meant to preserve these cards, and allow you to reference them, or to print off a readable card on your home printer, slip it into a card sleeve, and proxy with it.  Or proxy an entire deck idea - whatever you want to do.

I will be creating a PDF of every site card in the game as well, and it will be sorted by regions.

As I work to complete all of the cards, I will upload each Challenge Deck, to include the Community created Challenge Decks.

I hope you enjoy!!

**If you notice any issues with a card, please open an Issue and note which set and which card, and what the problem is.**

Thank you!

Jason
